# SmartNinja Mongo

A simple wrapper for MongoDB (`pymongo`) and TinyDB (`tinymongo`).

Use it if you don't want to (or can't) install MongoDB locally.

## Installation

Install the package via pip:

	pip install smartninja-mongo

Or add it in your `requirements.txt` and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Dependencies

SmartNinja Mongo automatically installs the following dependencies:

- `tinymongo`
- `pymongo`
- `tinydb`
- `tinydb_serialization` (used to easily convert datetime objects)

## How it works

You write your code as you would using the `pymongo` package. Except that you get the `MongoClient` class from the `smartninja_mongo` library (see examples below).

SmartNinja Mongo **automatically** figures out whether you're the program is running on **localhost** or on a **production** server.

If it's on **localhost**, TinyDB will be used instead of MongoDB via the `tinymongo` package (except if you set the `CUSTOM_MONGO_SERVER` env var).

If the app runs on **Heroku** or on **Azure**, the `smartninja_mongo` package automatically recognizes this and returns the `pymongo` client class instead of the one from `tinymongo`.

If your program runs in **some other production environment**, just set the `CUSTOM_MONGO_SERVER` env var (add any value to it that comes back as `True`, like for example `"1"`) and `pymongo` client will be used.

## Usage

SmartNinja Mongo's only task is to get you the right Mongo client:

	from smartninja_mongo.connection import MongoClient

	connection = MongoClient('mongodb://ds012345.mlab.com:56789/')

If your Python program runs on Heroku (for example), you'll get back a `MongoClient` from the `pymongo` library which has a connection to the production MongoDB database (in this case the mLab's Mongo database).

But if your app runs on localhost, a TinyDB instance will be created (you'll see a `localhost.db` folder created, put it in `.gitignore`).

Even if TinyDB is used on localhost instead of the MongoDB, you can write your code in the MongoDB way (or `pymongo` way).

See the following examples:

	db = connection.my_database
	
	collection = db.users
	
	user_id = collection.insert_one({"first_name": "Matej", "last_name": "Ramuta", "year_born": 1987}).inserted_id
	
	user_info = collection.find_one({"_id": user_id})
	
	print(user_info)

### More usage examples

For more usage examples see PyMongo docs: [https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/](https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/).

### Beware

There might be some incompatibilities between TinyMongo and PyMongo. Make sure to also check the [TinyMongo docs](https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to identify the problem if weird behavior occurs.
